      - Repository dev readme is populated with the initial setup instructions

  - name: Define data models
    description: >
      Design the core data structure for products, stores, layouts, pantry inventory, and recipes.
    tasks:
      - Create a `Product` model with name, unit, quantity, and category
      - Create a `Store` model with layout (ordered list of categories)
      - Create a `UserInventory` model representing the user’s pantry
      - Create `Recipe` and `RecipeIngredient` models

  - name: Extract ingredients from recipes
    description: >
      Implement an AI agent that parses recipe text and extracts structured ingredients (name, quantity, unit).
    tasks:
      - Allow users to paste a recipe as plain text or provide a recipe URL
      - Use an AI agent to extract structured ingredient data
      - Normalize ingredient names and match to known products

  - name: Match ingredients with pantry inventory
    description: >
      Compare required ingredients with the user’s current inventory to determine what needs to be purchased.
    tasks:
      - Compare quantities and units between ingredients and inventory
      - Compute quantity differences and prepare shopping list
      - Exclude ingredients already sufficiently stocked

  - name: Optimize shopping list based on store layout
    description: >
      Sort the shopping list according to the user’s selected store layout.
    tasks:
      - Retrieve the store layout associated with the user
      - Assign categories to each product
      - Sort the shopping list based on the store’s section order

  - name: Web interface and authentication
    description: >
      Build a responsive web interface with user registration, login, and session management.
    tasks:
      - Develop backend API using Django (with Django Rest Framework)
      - Build frontend using React + Tailwind CSS
      - Implement authentication (JWT or session-based)
      - Allow users to manage recipes, stores, inventory, and preferences

  - name: Personalization and habit learning
    description: >
      Track and learn from user corrections (e.g., category changes, quantity/unit edits).
    tasks:
      - Store user-specific corrections as `UserCorrection` entries
      - Apply learned preferences in future AI decisions
      - Allow users to view, edit, or reset their personalization data

  - name: (Optional) Promotions and price optimization
    description: >
      Integrate store circulars or APIs to recommend the cheapest options for products on the list.
    tasks:
      - Implement scrapers or integrations with store APIs
      - Map list products to current store promotions
      - Generate an alternate, price-optimized shopping list
